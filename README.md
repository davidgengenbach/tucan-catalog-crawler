**Deprecated!**

I wrote a python version ([vv-exporter.py](https://github.com/davidgengenbach/tucan-grades-exporter/blob/master/vv_exporter.py) - see repo README for instructions), which does not need an headless browser!

# Yeah
1. Clone or download repo
1. Execute `npm install`
1. Enter your tucan credentials in `user.json` (needed because you have to be logged in to see the courses you can take)
1. Execute `npm run get-courses`
1. `output/6.json` will hold all the information you need
1. Don't know... do something you really like instead of unnecessary stuff like this

## Optional: Display the data with [tucan-catalog](https://github.com/davidgengenbach/tucan-catalog)
_See repo README for that_
